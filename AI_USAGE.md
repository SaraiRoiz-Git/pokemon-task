# AI Usage Documentation

## Tools Used

**Primary Tool:** Cursor
- Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5

Throughout the Pokémon Dashboard task, I used AI as a supporting tool mainly to speed up writing, testing, and to keep things consistent. Before using AI, I performed a full manual review of the project and documented my findings myself.

## Main ways I used AI

**Code Review:** After completing my own manual review, I used AI to cross-check insights and refine the wording of my notes.

**React Query:** I used AI to speed up the initial setup and get quick examples.

**Tests:** All tests were written with the help of AI including setup, mocking, and the full test structure.

**Documentation:** All project documents, including this one, were created using AI-based templates, and I edited them to reflect my own analysis and decisions.

## Suggestions I did not adopt from AI

Some AI suggestions didn't fit the project's structure or the approach I wanted to maintain, so I chose not to use them.

**Examples:**

**Custom error handling / API logic:**
I preferred not to implement custom mechanisms and kept the solution simple and clear.

**Using Promise.allSettled:**
I decided not to adopt this, as it added unnecessary complexity for this project.

**Over-engineering:**
Suggestions involving splitting logic or creating extra hooks that didn't add real value.

**Data flow changes:**
Proposed state/props/fetching structures that didn't match what the project actually needed.

**Patterns that were not relevant:**
Complex patterns or conditional logic that weren't necessary.

**Bottom line:** I used AI for ideas and efficiency, but kept the code straightforward, readable, and aligned with the project's needs.

## Summary

AI supported me with writing, testing, and general efficiency but the architecture, decisions, and overall direction were based on my own manual review and understanding of the project.
